                    <ol>
                        <li>In a small bowl, combine warm milk, sugar, and fresh yeast. Leave it aside to rise.</li>
                        <li>In the meantime, sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Add a pinch of salt.
                        </li>
                        <li>Once the yeast mixture has risen, add melted butter (or olive oil), eggs, yogurt, and the
                            yeast
                            mixture into the
                            flour. Mix and knead the dough thoroughly until it becomes compact and smooth. If the dough
                            is
                            sticky, you can gradually
                            add more flour.</li>
                        <li>Cover the dough and let it rest in a warm spot for an hour or until it roughly doubles in
                            size.
                        </li>
                        <li>After the dough has risen, transfer it onto a clean surface. Use a rolling pin to stretch
                            the
                            dough to a thickness of
                            about 0.5cm.</li>
                        <li>Take a large round cookie cutter to cut out dough circles. If you don't have a cookie
                            cutter, a
                            regular round glass
                            can be used as an alternative.</li>
                        <li>Cut as many dough circles as needed, and the remaining dough can be kneaded, rolled out, and
                            cut
                            again.</li>
                        <li>Take a dough disc in your hand and add tomato sauce, diced ham (or pepperoni), and grated
                            cheese as
                            desired.
                            Fold the disc in half
                            and twist it around itself to create a petal shape.</li>
                        <li>Place the shaped petals into a round baking tray, starting from the center and adding more
                            petals around the center
                            ones until the tray is filled.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle the flower pizza with parmigiano cheese.</li>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC (350ºF) and bake the flower pizza for approximately 25 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Serve the flower-shaped pizza on a large plate or serving platter. Each petal can be pulled
                            individually.</li>

                        <li>For the best burgers, go to the butcher’s and ask for some lean beef steak mince and for him
                            to mince some nice smoky
                            bacon.</li>
                        <li>In a large mixing bowl mix the beef and bacon mince, add a little freshly ground black
                            pepper. There is no need to add
                            salt, as you will get it from bacon.</li>
                        <li>Divide the meet into 4, with wet hands roll into a ball, then press flat patties roughly
                            12cm wide. Place in the fridge
                            to chill.</li>
                        <li>Prepare the Top Secret Bacon Sauce. Finely dice the onions and bacon. Add them to a
                            preheated non-stick pan, sauté until
                            they become caramelised. Remove from heat and transfer into a food processor, blend until
                            combines into a paste.</li>
                        <li>Halve the buns, slice the gherkins, tomatoes and finely chop the lettuce.</li>
                        <li>Cook the burgers two at a time to achieve perfection. Heat up a large non-stick pan on high
                            heat.</li>
                        <li>Oil lightly and put two burgers into the pan, pressing down on them lightly.</li>
                        <li>After about 2 minutes, flip the burger and leave for another 2 minutes. Add a cheese slice
                            on top of each burger, add a
                            tiny splash of water to the pan and cover with a lid for about 30 seconds to melt the
                            cheese.</li>
                        <li>At the same time toast the buns in the same pan we sautéed the onion and bacon for the best
                            flavour.</li>
                        <li>To build a burger, Add a preferred sauce and lettuce to the bottom of a bun, we recommend a
                            combination of a mayo and
                            ketchup, top with a cheesy burger Pattie, tomatoes and gherkins. Before placing the top bun,
                            spread the Secret Bacon
                            Sauce generously over the bun.</li>
                        <li>Serve with a fresh home made French fries right away, to prevent the bun soaking too much of
                            the juices, or wrap each
                            burger in a greaseproof paper, give it a minute and enjoy the juicy sloppy goodness. </li>

                        <li><strong>Profiteroles:</strong> In a medium-sized pot, combine water and butter, and heat
                            over medium heat until the butter has melted and the mixture
                            starts simmering.</li>
                        <li>Slowly add the flour mixed with baking powder and salt to the pot, while continuously
                            stirring. Mix
                            for about 10 minutes until
                            the dough forms a smooth consistency, ensuring it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot.
                        </li>
                        <li>Remove the pot from heat and gradually incorporate one egg at a time into the dough, making
                            sure each egg is thoroughly
                            combined before adding the next one.</li>
                        <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Using a teaspoon, scoop half a spoonful of the
                            dough and place it onto the
                            tray, using your finger to gently release it from the spoon. Leaving enough space between
                            each profiterole on the tray
                            to allow for expansion during baking.</li>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC (350ºF) and bake the profiteroles for 30-40 minutes until they
                            turn golden brown. Once out of
                            the oven, immediately cut the profiteroles in half.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cream:</strong> In a pot, heat 400ml of milk until it reaches a simmer. In a
                            separate bowl, mix 100ml of milk with flour and an egg
                            until well combined.</li>
                        <li>Gradually add the milk mixture to the warm milk in the pot, stirring continuously. Add the
                            sugar to the pot and cook the mixture, stirring consistently, until it thickens.</li>
                        <li>Remove the pot from heat and allow the cream mixture to cool. In a separate bowl, combine
                            the butter with the vanilla sugar, then incorporate it into the cooled cream mixture.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assembly:</strong>Take the profiteroles and fill them with the prepared cream.
                            Before serving, dust the profiteroles with icing sugar or cover with chocolate for a simple
                            decoration.</li>
